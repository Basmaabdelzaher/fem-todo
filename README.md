# Todo List with Light mode

A project from "Frontend Mentor" Website. I implemented this project using React Framework.
The project allows the user to add todos, mark em as completed or delete em from the list. It counts the number of uncompleted todos and give you the option to clear all completed tasks. It has dark mode and light mode option as well.

To run the code on your machine:

- download or clone the code
- install all required dependencies by `npm install`
- to start the application run `npm start`
